# CAF Neighborhood Analysis in Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDAC)

## Overview

This repository contains R scripts for custom analyses of cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF) neighborhoods and their impact on pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). The code in this repository was used to perform data preprocessing, CAF and epithelial subtype characterization, neighborhood-based analyses, and figure generation for the associated manuscript.

The scripts are organized to allow reproducible execution of the analysis pipeline, from loading processed data to generating the figures presented in the paper.

## Associated paper

This repository is associated with the following manuscript:

> **Cancer associated fibroblasts promote epithelial to mesenchymal transition and classical to basal change in pancreatic cancer cells in association with loss of IL-8 expression**  

## Input data

All raw MCD data files, and the backup_output.rds files containing the fully annotated data frame required to reproduce the manuscript figures, are available at 10.5281/zenodo.14871170
